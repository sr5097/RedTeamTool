I have three distraction tools built as a part of my red team tools assignment.

# 1. Apache Stop

This is a simple Bash script that randomly stops the Apache service, (which would most likely be a scored service).

This script assumes that there is an existing apache service running.

This script has been built and tested on an Ubuntu machine.

# 2. Password Change

This is a python script that randomly prompts the user randomly to change their password.

It is just being used to distract and take time away from the Blue team members.

The username for the user in this case is "student" but can be easily changed or can include a list of users for ease of use within the competition.

# 3. Prompt

This is a python script that throws random pop-ups on the screen and the prompts continue to show up until the answer is "yes" to a specific question.
